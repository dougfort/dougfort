# [Programmer](http://programming-motherfucker.com/)

I heard about programming around 1960 when I was ten. I've wanted to be a programmer ever since.

I'm intensively studying [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Looking for interesting projects.

I'm particularly interested in the work of [Martin Kleppmann](https://martin.kleppmann.com/), especially [local-first systems](https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/local-first.pdf)
